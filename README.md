# When Contributor's Documentation

This repository contains documentation useful to contribute to **When**, separated from the main *User Manual* and rewritten in *reStructuredText* for [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/).

To compile it, provided that *Sphinx 1.3* or later is installed, the following steps should be sufficient:

```
$ mkdir _build
$ sphinx-build -a -b html . _build
```

The *User Manual* is available at http://when-documentation.readthedocs.io/ as usual.
